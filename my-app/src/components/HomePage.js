          <p>
            The League of Legends World Championship (also known as Worlds) is
            the premier yearly international tournament that brings together the
            top teams to compete for the Summonerâ€™s Cup and earn the title of
            World Champion. More than 800 players on 100+ professional League of
            Legends esports teams compete across a dozen leagues globally
            throughout the year to qualify for the tournament. The event moves
            between host regions each year; this year, four cities across North
            America will play host to the various tournament stages.
